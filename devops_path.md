# 🚀 DevOps Learning Roadmap – The Real-World Playbook 🎯

---

### 🔧 **Master Git**  
🎭 Not just push/pull. Handle **merge conflicts**, `merge`, and `rebase` like a boss.

---

### ☁️ **Pick One Cloud Provider**  
🌩️ AWS, Azure, or GCP – **go deep, not wide**. Become a ninja in one.

---

### 📜 **Live in YAML**  
👾 Kubernetes, Docker Compose, Ansible – indentation will haunt you 😅

---

### 🔄 **Build Real CI/CD Pipelines**  
🏗️ Not tutorials. Build pipelines that **deploy real apps** — break things, fix them, repeat.

---

### 🌍 **Deploy Something Public**  
🧪 A live site beats 10 certificates. If people can visit it, it matters.

---

### 🛠️ **Learn Infrastructure as Code**  
🌱 Terraform or Pulumi — **clicking in consoles is so 2015**.

---

### 🐧 **Get Comfortable with Linux**  
🖥️ SSH, file permissions, `systemd` services — welcome to your new home: **the terminal**.

---

### 🔐 **Think Security First**  
🧯 Scan containers, manage secrets the right way, understand IAM — don’t get hacked.

---

### 📈 **Monitor Everything**  
👀 Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, etc.  
**If you can’t see it, you can’t fix it.**

---

### 🤖 **Automate Boring Stuff**  
⚙️ Write scripts to save time. That’s how you **think like DevOps**.

---

### 💥 **Break Things (Safely)**  
🔥 Practice **chaos engineering** — knowing how systems fail is knowing how to build them better.

---

### ✍️ **Document Your Wins**  
📘 Blog about problems you solved. Show how you think, not just what you did.

---

## 🧠 Brutal Truth:  
👉 **Your GitHub profile matters more than your resume.**  
So build, break, fix, and share!

🎨 *Stay scrappy. Stay curious. Ship often.* 🛳️

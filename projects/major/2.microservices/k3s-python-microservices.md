# K3s-based Python Microservices Deployment Pipeline

**Skills Covered**:  
- Python (FastAPI): Building RESTful APIs for microservices  
- Docker: Containerizing applications  
- K3s: Lightweight Kubernetes distribution for deployment  
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD automation  
- Prometheus & Grafana: Monitoring and visualization

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for developing, containerizing, deploying, and monitoring Python microservices using K3s.

---

## Tasks Breakdown

1. **Develop Microservices**
    - Build three independent FastAPI-based microservices:
        - `auth`: Handles authentication and JWT token issuance.
        - `users`: Manages user profiles and CRUD operations.
        - `products`: Manages product catalog and inventory.
    - Write unit tests for each service.

2. **Containerization**
    - Write Dockerfiles for each microservice.
    - Build and tag Docker images.
    - Push images to DockerHub under a consistent naming convention.

3. **Kubernetes Manifests**
    - Create Kubernetes YAML files for:
        - Deployments and Services for each microservice.
        - ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment variables and sensitive data.
        - Ingress resource using nginx for routing and TLS termination.
    - Use cert-manager and Let's Encrypt for automated TLS certificates.

4. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
    - Set up workflows to:
        - Run tests on pull requests.
        - Build and push Docker images on main branch pushes.
        - Optionally, automate deployment to K3s via kubectl or Helm.

5. **Monitoring & Observability**
    - Deploy Prometheus to scrape metrics from all microservices.
    - Expose Prometheus metrics endpoints in each FastAPI app.
    - Set up Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## Deliverables

- Source code for all microservices
- Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests
- GitHub Actions workflow files
- Documentation for setup and usage
- Example Grafana dashboards

---

## Bonus

- Implement API Gateway pattern with authentication.
- Add distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger or OpenTelemetry).
- Use Helm charts for deployment automation.
